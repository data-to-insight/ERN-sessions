The definition for iterable is a bit circular because an iterable is something we can loop over, but maybe an example will helps. We can iterate over elements in a list, keys/values/items in a dictionary, rows/columns in a dataframe etc.\n",

To keep things simple, we'll largely be thinking of conditionals in terms of using them to make selections from dataframes, and using them to determine what actions to apply in certain instances. For instance, in a dataframe of children in need, we might want to select only rows where the age is above, say 16. We can do this with a conditional. We might also want to make a new column to say yes if a child is over 16, and no if they are under. We can use a conditional for this too."
